**How to Play**

Each game lasts for 5 minutes and with each question, you will be given 5 pixels to place on the canvas. However with each incorrect answer, it will randomly remove a pixel from your canvas so be careful! Don't think about banking your pixels to hide from the incorrect asnwers because if you go 10 seconds without using any, all your pixels will delete.
